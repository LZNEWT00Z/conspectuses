    "\n",
    "When the data changes frequently, requires shared access, doesn't fit in memory, and security is critical, a database is a great solution. A database is a data representation that lives on disk that can be queried, accessed, and updated without using much memory. We primarily interact with a database using a [database management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) or **DBMS** for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the pandas workflow, we spend most of our time thinking about what functions and methods to use, where to store intermediate results in variables, and juggling all of these. To work with data stored in a database, we instead use a language called **SQL** (or structured query language). In SQL, we express each unique request (whether it be fetching a subset of or editing values in the data) as a single query and then ask the DBMS to run the query and display any results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to fetch a specific subset of the data from a database, we would:\n",
    "\n",
    "* write the SQL query: `SELECT * FROM salaries`\n",
    "* ask the DBMS to run the query and display the results to us\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the data lives on disk, we can work with datasets that consume multiple terabytes of disk space. Many data science teams in industry have servers and setups in cloud environments like Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services that let team members work with this scale of data. Robust and popular DBMS tools like [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) include powerful features for managing user credentials, security, and high data throughput (quickly changing data). We'll learn the fundamentals of SQL using a small, portable DBMS called [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/). SQLite is the most popular database in the world and is lightweight enough that the SQLite DBMS is included as a [module in Python](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/sqlite3.html). Later we'll dive into production systems like Postgres.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore data from the American Community Survey on job outcome statistics based on college majors. While the original CSV version can be found on [FiveThirtyEight's Github](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors), we'll be using a slightly modified version of the data that's stored as a database. We'll be working with the bit of data that contains the 2010-2012 data for recent college grads only. We'll learn how to write SQL queries to explore and start to understand the dataset."

    "The ability to quickly iterate on queries as you think of new questions is the appeal of SQL. The SQL workflow lets data professionals focus on asking and answering questions, instead of lower level programming concepts.

This allows people who need to ask and answer questions easily transfer their SQL experience, even as database technologies change. For example, the [Presto project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presto_%28SQL_query_engine%29) lets you query using SQL but use data from database systems like MySQL, from a distributed file system like HDFS, and more."

    "## Writing More Complex Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL operations we've learned so far enable us to answer questions with only one source of uncertainty. Many times, we want to answer questions that have 2 or more levels of unknowns. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which rows are above the average for the ShareWomen column?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the SQL techniques we've learned so far, there's no way to write a query that answers this question. As of right now, we only know aggregate functions such as `AVG()` is valid in the `SELECT` clause; however, they can be used in other clauses such as the `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses. For example, The following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT * FROM recent_grads\n",
    "WHERE ShareWomen > AVG(ShareWomen)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "will return an error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(sqlite3.OperationalError) misuse of aggregate function AVG() [SQL: 'SELECT * FROM recent_grads WHERE ShareWomen > AVG(ShareWomen)']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to instead learn how to break up a question we want to answer into a series of queries that can be combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine which majors are above the average for the `ShareWomen` column, we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* first determine the average value for the `ShareWomen` column\n",
    "* then select and filter the rows that are greater than the average value\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had to do this using Python and pandas, we would compute and store the average value in `ShareWomen` as a variable and then use the variable in a table filter. While variables dominate how we express logic in object-oriented programming languages like Python and Java, SQL doesn't have support for variables. The designers of SQL, a [declarative programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming), want it's users to focus on expressing computations over explicitly defining, setting, and juggling variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "What would the query look like if we already knew the average value for the `ShareWomen` column?\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT Major, ShareWomen FROM recent_grads\n",
    "WHERE ShareWomen > 0.5225502029537575\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how do we make the computed average value, 0.5225502029537575, dynamic?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's introduce the SQL way to solve this problem -- **subqueries**. A subquery is a query nested within another query. Here's a template for a SQL statement where the subquery resides in the `WHERE` clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT Major, ShareWomen FROM recent_grads\n",
    "WHERE ShareWomen > (subquery that returns the average value for ShareWomen)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The subquery is run first and returns the average value for the `ShareWomen` column (which happens to be 0.5225502029537575). Based on the result of the subquery, SQL will replace the subquery with this value dynamically. Note that SQL will ignore the column name (`AVG(ShareWomen)`) and is smart enough to just use the actual row value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The query that replaces the placeholder `subquery` needs to be a full query (contain `SELECT` and `FROM` clauses, etc), that works even if it's run separately. In addition, the inner query should only return a table with a single row and column because of where it fits in the outer query (`... WHERE > ?`).\n",
    "\n",
    "A subquery must always be contained within parentheses `()`."
