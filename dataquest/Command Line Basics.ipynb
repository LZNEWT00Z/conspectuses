    "# Command Line Basics\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Quick Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtually all programmers and data scientists make extensive use of the terminal, and knowing how to interact with it is a critical skill. Every operating system has a slightly different terminal with different commands and syntax. Because Linux and OS X are both based on an older operating system called UNIX, they both have very similar terminals. Windows isn't based on UNIX, so it has different commands. It's more common to use Linux and OS X for data science work, so we will use Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "The terminal that we'll be using uses a programming language called BASH. Bash is a language used with command line interfaces to provide an alternative to the GUI and can be much quicker as results are seen within a matter of seconds. An impressive feature that BASH uses is called command line completion i.e., autocorrect with just the touch of a tab key. The feature will match partly typed program names, filenames, and variables. When installing tools such as `pip`, `python`, and other useful tools that can supercharge your workflow, BASH understands `apt-get`, which is a command to install programs such as `docker`, `pip`, and even command line games!\n",
    "\n",
    "To the right is a terminal interface. The dollar sign is called the command prompt. Anything we type to the right of it is a shell command that will execute immediately when we press the Enter key.\n",
    "\n",
    "For UNIX terminals, here is a list of some Bash commands. For a quick command comparison, you can click here for a comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### First Command\n",
    "\n",
    "The first command we'll learn is `pwd`. This command returns the current directory (folder you're located in). It's an acronym that stands for **print working directory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The terminal was designed to navigate and switch between directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pwd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Changing Directories\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the `cd` command (which stands for **change directory**) to switch directories. For example, we can type `cd /` to switch to the **root** directory. The root directory, or /, is a special directory that will navigate to the root of the filesystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "cd /\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Absolute/Relative Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "When we typed the forward slash (`/`), the terminal switched to the root directory. Any path that starts with `/` is an `absolute path` that's written in relation to the root of the filesystem. On the other hand, **relative paths** are relative to the directory we're currently in. These don't start with a forward slash. If we're in the `home` folder, for example, typing `cd Anton` will move us to `/home/Anton`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "cd Anton\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### User\n",
    "\n",
    "Most popular operating systems have a concept of users. Users have certain permissions within the system, can create their own files, and run their own programs. Users can also restrict other users from accessing their files and running their programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can check which user we're logged in as with the `whoami` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "whoami\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Home Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Every user has their own home directory within `/home` where they can add files specific to their username. For example, the home directory for `Anton` is at `/home/Anton`. The tilde (`~`) is a shortcut for referring to the home directory. Typing `cd ~` will automatically take us to the current user's home directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "cd ~\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Creating Directories\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also create files and directories with the terminal. We'll explore how to make a directory first. We can do this with the `mkdir` command. We just have to type `mkdir test` to create a directory called `test`. This will also add a folder icon to the corresponding location in your GUI file browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that rules about absolute and relative paths apply here, and in almost every command that involves paths. If we type `mkdir` test, the shell will make a directory called `test` in the current folder, because it's a relative path. If we type `mkdir /home/Anton/test` instead, the shell will make a folder called test inside the `/home/Anton` folder, because it's an absolute path.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "mkdir test\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Options\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands have *options* that can modify their behavior. We specify these options by adding them, preceded by one dash, after we invoke the command.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, adding the `-v` option, or \"flag,\" after the `mkdir` command will turn on *\"verbose\"* mode, and print output when it makes the folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since verbose mode communicates what action it takes to the terminal, this is helpful if you need information or output on the command. Since it provides more output on the screen, you will be able to get real time information on what is happening as it is happening. As you continue throughout the command line courses, you might find it helpful to use verbose mode when you practice using each command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "mkdir -v\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Reviewing Available Command Options\n",
    "\n",
    "Most commands will let us use the `--help` flag to see what all of the possible options are. A flag comes after a command. When you use the `--help` flag, you don't need to specify a directory -- the shell will automatically know that you want to see the help contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "mkdir --help\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Listing The Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've made a couple of directories, let's see what's in our home folder. We can use the `ls` command to list all of the files and folders in a directory. If we pass in the `-l` option, it will format the list nicely as a table.\n",

    "# Working With Files\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Making A File\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll look at files more closely and learn how to interact with them on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to **create** a file. While there are several ways to do this, we'll start with the `touch` command. This command will create an empty file with the name we give it. For example, typing `touch file.txt` will create a new file called `file.txt` in the current directory. We can open the file and edit it later on if we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use the `touch` command to change the date we last accessed a file if we need to. You can read more about the touch command on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_(Unix)).\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "touch test.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Standard Streams\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've created the `test.txt` file, you can add text to it in a few different ways. The first is with the `echo` command, which simply prints whatever you tell it to as output. If you type echo `\"Dataquest is awesome\"`, it will print `Dataquest is awesome`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It prints this text into a stream called **standard output**, or `stdout`. Every program writes to standard output, and receives input through **standard input** (`stdin`). Whenever a program experiences an error while running, it writes the error message to standard error (`stderr`). These standard streams are how programs show us output in the terminal, and how we enter input.\n",
    "\n",
    "`stdout` and `stderr` usually display on the monitor, while `stdin` is the input from the keyboard. In this case, `echo` is taking a string from `stdin`, and printing that string to `stdout`. By default, we see the message that it prints to `stdout`, because it shows on the monitor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interfaces look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "                          Stdout\n",
    "           Stdin          ----->\n",
    "|Keyboard| ----> |Program|      > |Display|\n",
    "                          ----->\n",
    "                          Stderr\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`stdout`, `stderr`, and `stdin` exist because these standard streams allow the interfaces to be abstract. A program doesn't need to care whether it's getting input from a keyboard, file, or somewhere else. A program also doesn't need to care if it's outputting to the display, a file, or somewhere else. The standard streams allow us to hook various inputs and outputs up to programs without the programs having to concern themselves with what those inputs and outputs are.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "echo \"Hello There\"\n",
    "echo Hello There # same output in the console\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Redirecting Standard Streams\n",
    "\n",
    "We can redirect standard streams in order to connect them to different sources. For example, we can connect `stdout` to a file. Afterwards, the program the stream is connected to will write to a file instead of the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "To redirect, we use the greater than sign (`>`). For example, echo `\"Dataquest is awesome\" > dataquest.txt` will write `Dataquest is awesome` to `stdout`, then redirect `stdout` to the file `dataquest.txt`. The end result is that the stream will write `Dataquest is awesome` to the file `dataquest.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "echo \"Hello There\" > test.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Editing A File\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also edit a file directly from the terminal, without redirection. While there are a few programs that let us do this, the simplest is called `nano`. **Nano** is a command line text editor that lets us edit and save files directly from the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run `nano`, type `nano`, followed by the name of the file you want to edit. For example, `nano test.txt` will open the `test.txt` file for editing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a file is open, we can make whatever changes we want, then hit `ctrl+x` to quit. When we quit, the terminal will prompt us to save our work. Typing `Y` (for yes), then pressing Enter will save all changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "nano test.txt\n",
    "# A GNU IS OPENED\n",
    "# Editting (or even deleting!) the text in the file using nano\n",
    "# Closing and saving the file (Control-key sequences are notated with a '^' and can be entered either by using the Ctrl key or pressing the Esc key twice)\n",
    "# You're in shell again!\n",

    "### Overview Of File Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Unix, every file and folder has permissions associated with it. These permissions have three scopes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `owner` - The user who created the file or folder\n",
    "* `group` - Users in the owner's group (on Unix systems, an owner can place users in groups)\n",
    "* `everyone` - All other users on the system who aren't the user or in the user's group\n",
    "\n",
    "Each scope can have any of three permissions (a scope can have multiple permissions at once):\n",
    "\n",
    "* `read` - The ability to see what's in a file (if defined on a folder, the ability to see what files are in a folder)\n",
    "* `write` - The ability to modify a file (if a folder, the ability to delete, modify, and rename files in the folder)\n",
    "* `execute` - The ability to run a file (some files are executable, and need this permission to run)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each permission can be granted or denied to each scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view the permissions on files and folders using `ls -l`. This command will display the permissions to the left of each file name. Here's an example of what the output looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "ls -l\n",
    "\n",
    "    total 4\n",
    "\n",
    "    -rw-r--r-- 1 dq dq 10 Nov 14 00:08 test.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the permissions for the file `test.txt` are `-rw-r--r--`. There are 10 characters in that string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Breakingdownthepermissionsstring\n",
    "  -      rw-     r--      r--\n",
    "Ignore   User   Group   Everyone\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry about the first character for now. Starting at the second character, the permissions are split into three groups -- one for `user`, one for `group`, and one for `everyone`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `owner` has the permissions `rw-`, which corresponds to characters `2` through `4` in the string. This means that the owner can ***r**ead* and ***w**rite* the file, but not execute it. The first character represents read permissions, the second represents write permissions, and the third execute permissions. The character for **read** is `r`, the character for **write** is `w`, and the character for **execute** is `x`. If a scope doesn't have a permission, it displays as a dash (`-`). If the permissions for the owner were `rwx` instead, the owner would be able to execute as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The permissions for `group` are represented by characters `5` through `7` in the string, which corresponds to `r--`. This means that people in the owner's group can only read the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The permissions for `everyone` are `r--`, meaning that anyone who has an account on this machine can read the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Octal Notation For File Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "We just looked at file permissions that looked like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`-rw-r--r--`\n",
    "\n",
    "We call this symbolic notation for permissions, because it expresses each permission as a symbol. The downside to symbolic notation is that if we want to change permissions, it takes a long time to type the changes out. We can do this more quickly by representing permissions with **octal notation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Octal notation** allows us to represent the permissions for all scopes with just `4` digits, rather than the `10` characters involved in symbolic notation. There are `8` possible combinations of the three permissions `r`, `w`, and `x`. We can express each combination, or scope, as a single digit in an octal (base `8`) counting system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the combinations and their corresponding digits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `---` : No permissions; corresponds to `0`\n",
    "* `--x` : Execute only permission; corresponds to `1`\n",
    "* `-w-` : Write only permissions; corresponds to `2`\n",
    "* `-wx` : Write and execute permissions; corresponds to `3`\n",
    "* `r--` : Read only permissions; corresponds to `4`\n",
    "* `r-x` : Read and execute permissions; corresponds to `5`\n",
    "* `rw-` : Read and write permissions; corresponds to `6`\n",
    "* `rwx` : Read, write, and execute permissions; corresponds to `7`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use this system to convert the permissions string `-rw-r--r--` to `0644`. When reading octal notation, we read the digits from left to right. The first digit in the sequence is sets a *Special Mode*. For more information on what the first digit actually is, you can visit this article on [setuid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can pull up a file's octal permissions with the `stat` command. Typing `stat test.txt` will show us some information about the file `test.txt`, including the octal permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `stat` command returns quite a bit of detailed information about the file. Let's focus on the permissions for the moment; we can find them in the `Access` section.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",

    "\n",
    "Rather than relying on extensions to determine file type, Unix-based operating systems like Linux use **media** types, which are also called **MIME** types. The MIME type `application/pdf` indicates that a file is a `pdf`, and the MIME type `image/png` indicates that a file is a `png` image. The *first* part of the MIME type string is *for the type*, such as `application` or `image`, and the *second* part is *for the subtype*, such as `pdf` or `png`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are MIME types for every type of file. The MIME type is stored in the file *metadata* (which is stored as part of the file). As a result, Linux can determine a file's type and open it properly, even if it doesn't have an extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rename files and remove extensions whenever we want. In fact, we'll often come across files that don't have extensions, such as `test`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifying a folder as the second argument to `mv` will preserve the file name, and move it into the folder. *If we specify a full path instead, including the file name*, it will move the original file to the new file name, *essentially renaming* it. For example, `mv test.txt test2.txt` will move the file `test.txt` to `test2.txt`. This will basically rename `test.txt`.\n",

    "If we create a variable named `FOOD` with the value `Shrimp gumbo`, for example, we'll need to use `$FOOD` when we want to access the value again later. This is because typing `FOOD` at the command prompt will attempt to call the command `FOOD`. It will return an error, because there's no executable command named `FOOD` in `PATH`. We'll discuss `PATH` more in-depth later, but for now: `PATH` is a dynamic-named value specifying a set of directories where executable programs are located.\n",

    "Then, we used `os.environ`, a dictionary containing all of the values for the environment variables. We can access any environment variable by specifying it as a key, just like we can with any Python dictionary.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can do this because of the `PATH` environment variable, which is configured to point to several folders (creating a \"shortcut\"). We can run any program in any one of these folders just by typing the program's name. Because `/usr/bin` is one of the folders in `PATH` and `python` is in that folder, we can access the python interpreter just by typing `python`, instead of the full path. If we did not have a `PATH` variable, we would have to type in the absolute path to run `python` every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier we discussed how to create environment variables. We can re-create an environment variable called `PATH` and append our new directory. For example, `export PATH=\"/usr/bin:$PATH\"` will allow us to type in the name of any executable inside `/usr/bin` at any time without typing the absolute path in order to execute the file.\n",

    "### Flags\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the programs we've been running have arguments, and some don't. When we type `echo $FOOD`, we're passing in the value of the `$FOOD` variable as a positional argument to the `echo` program. This is similar to a function in Python, which has positional and keyword arguments. Programs can have any number of positional arguments, including zero. `python` is an example of a program that doesn't require any positional arguments.\n",

    "Programs can also have optional *flags*. These are like keyword arguments in Python, which modify program behavior. For example, if we pass the `-l` flag (for \"**l**ong mode\") to `ls` (the \"**l**i**s**t\" command), the command will list the files in the directory in long mode, meaning that it will show more information about them.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, `ls -a`, and `ls --all` do the same thing -- they'll both list all of the files in a directory, rather than hiding files that begin with a dot (`.`). The commands are equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have multiple flags with short, single-character names, we can chain them together to save time. `ls -la` will list **a**ll of the files in **l**ong format; it's equivalent to `ls -a -l`. The order of the l and the a don't matter. While experienced programmers do this all the time, it can be a bit confusing to parse at first.\n",

    "The interpreter lets us run Python commands and see their results immediately. It's very useful for testing snippets of code quicky, as well as debugging. But it's not a good way to develop Python programs, because the commands aren't saved anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to develop Python programs, we'll need to make files containing Python code. Then we'll be able to use the interpreter to run them from the command line. This way, we can save all of our commands, but still see what's happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very common way to develop with Python -- use an IDE or text editor to create Python files, then run them from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make a file that Python can execute on the command line by adding some lines of Python code to a blank file. Here's an example of Python code:\n",

    "This code works because the `__name__` variable in Python scripts is automatically set to the name of the module. If the module is being run from the command line, the `__name__` variable will be `__main__` by default. Checking the `__name__` variable allows us to tell whether a script is running from the command line or not. By the way, using the default `python` executable will launch Python version 2. Use `python3` instead to launch the third version.\n",
