    "Git is a command-line tool we can access by typing `git` in the shell. The first step in using Git is to initialize a folder as a [repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository). A repository (or \"repo\") tracks multiple versions of the files in the folder, enabling collaboration.\n",

    "The typical Git workflow involves adding files, making changes, and then storing a checkpoint (or \"snapshot\") of those changes. These checkpoints are called `commits`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of storing every file in every commit, Git stores the `diff`, or the things that change between `commits`.\n",

    "The working directory is the folder we're version controlling with Git, and the contents of the working directory are what we see when we list the contents of the folder with `ls`. In our case, `~/PyPlayg/dq/Git/pseudo-chatbot` is the working directory. We can edit the working directory by changing or adding files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we have one file named `README.md` in the **working directory**. There are no files in the staging area, and no commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run `git add`, Git adds the difference between the most recent commit and the current status of our working directory to the **staging area**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run `git commit`, we create a commit that contains all of the changes Git added to the staging area. The commit has a unique commit hash, so we can refer to it later. Note how making a commit removes all changes from the **staging area**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have a commit with the hash. This commit is a snapshot of the working directory at the moment it contained a file called README.md with it's data.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Introduction to Git Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Git gives us a few ways to avoid merge conflicts. The best method involves using branches. Similar to the way tree branches diverge from the trunk, Git branches allow us to create several different work areas within the same repo. It's common to create a new branch whenever we want to make a change to a project, and then merge that branch back into the master branch when we're done.\n",
    "\n",
    "When each person pushes their branch to the remote, Git stores it separately so that it doesn't conflict with everyone else's changes. Afterwards, the remote will have all of the branches. While the team will eventually want to merge all of the branches into master, using branches allows them to make changes to the repo separately while avoiding conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a branch with the [git branch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch) command. For example, `git branch rocky` will create a branch called `rocky`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, we can switch to the new branch using the [git checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout) command. To do this, we'd type `git checkout rocky`. Alternatively, we can create a shortcut by combining the two commands with `git checkout -b rocky`. This will create a branch named rocky and then switch to it right away, without our having to type a second, separate command.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `git checkout` command allows us to switch branches. If we still have changes in the working directory we haven't committed yet, though, Git will check whether there's a potential merge conflict with the branch we're switching to. If there is, Git won't let us change branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "To redirect some code into a file, we can use the `printf` command. [Printf](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_printf.htm) is a C library function that sends formatted output to stdout.\n",

It's typical to use a branch to develop a single feature, merge that branch into `master`, and then delete the branch.\n",

If a branch has unmerged commits inside it, Git will prevent it from being deleted, so its generally safe to delete branches we think are old or unnecessary. If you are extremely sure you want to delete the branch with unmerged commits inside it, you can do so with `git branch -D`\n",

    "* Make your changes on the branch and create commits\n",

    "* Ask others to review and evaluate your branch\n",
    "* Merge the branch into master once everyone thinks it looks okay\n",

    "\n",
    "This is how most teams of developers work. In order to review a team member's changes, though, it's critical to be able to see the differences between the feature branch and `master`. We refer to these differences as \"the diff.\"\n",

    "When we use GitHub as our remote repo, [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) will show us the differences between branches in an attractive interface, and allow other developers to add comments.\n",

If the changes are additions, Git will display them in green and prefix them with a plus sign (`+`). If they're deletions, Git will display them in red and prefix them with a minus sign (`-`). It shows new files as additions.\n",

    "When we merge a branch into another one, our changes can sometimes conflict with other people's commits. When Git can't merge commits automatically, it informs the user of a merge conflict and asks them to sort it out. Sorting out a merge conflict involves editing the code that conflicts to create the \"correct\" version. This way, the person who wrote the code is in charge of resolving the issue, and Git isn't intentionally overwriting anyone's changes.\n",

    "## Aborting a Merge\n",
    "\n",
    "When a merge conflict occurs, Git adds markup lines to the problem files to identify where the conflicts are. These lines can prevent code from executing properly, because the Python interpreter doesn't understand them. It's important to resolve conflicts and remove the markup immediately for this reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to resolve a conflict is to abort the merge altogether. We can do this with [git merge --abort](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'd typically do an abort if we merged one branch into another by accident, or wanted to deal with large merge conflicts in another way. When we abort a merge, Git resets the working directory and Git history to the state they were in before we tried to merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "git merge --abort\n",
    "#fatal: There is no merge to abort (MERGE_HEAD missing).\n",
