    "Git is a command-line tool we can access by typing `git` in the shell. The first step in using Git is to initialize a folder as a [repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository). A repository (or \"repo\") tracks multiple versions of the files in the folder, enabling collaboration.\n",

    "The typical Git workflow involves adding files, making changes, and then storing a checkpoint (or \"snapshot\") of those changes. These checkpoints are called `commits`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of storing every file in every commit, Git stores the `diff`, or the things that change between `commits`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we explore commits further, let's take a closer look at the working directory and how it interacts with commits. The Git commit workflow has three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The working directory\n",
    "* The staging area\n",
    "* Commits\n",
    "\n",
    "The working directory is the folder we're version controlling with Git, and the contents of the working directory are what we see when we list the contents of the folder with `ls`. In our case, `~/PyPlayg/dq/Git/pseudo-chatbot` is the working directory. We can edit the working directory by changing or adding files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we have one file named `README.md` in the **working directory**. There are no files in the staging area, and no commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run `git add`, Git adds the difference between the most recent commit and the current status of our working directory to the **staging area**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run `git commit`, we create a commit that contains all of the changes Git added to the staging area. The commit has a unique commit hash, so we can refer to it later. Note how making a commit removes all changes from the **staging area**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have a commit with the hash. This commit is a snapshot of the working directory at the moment it contained a file called README.md with it's data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, basic logic behind the whole process of a commit looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1.\n",
    "Working Directory        Staging Area\n",

    "We can pull up the difference between two commits with the [git diff](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) command -- we just pass the two commit hashes as arguments to `git diff`.
