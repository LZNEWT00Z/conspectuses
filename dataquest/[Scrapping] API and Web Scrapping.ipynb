    "## Working with API\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few situations where data sets don't work well:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data change frequently. It doesn't really make sense to regenerate a data set of stock prices, for example, and download it every minute. This approach would require a lot of bandwidth, and be very slow\n",
    "* You only want a small piece of a much larger data set. Reddit comments are one example. What if you want to pull just your own comments from reddit? It doesn't make much sense to download the entire reddit database, then filter it for a few items\n",
    "* It involves repeated computation. For example, Spotify has an API that can tell you the genre of a piece of music. You could theoretically create your own classifier and use it to categorize music, but you'll never have as much data as Spotify does\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases like these, an **application program interface (API)** is the right solution. An API is a set of methods and tools that allows different applications to interact with each other. Programmers use APIs to query and retrieve data dynamically (which they can then integrate with their own apps). A client can retrieve information quickly and effectively through an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reddit, Spotify, Twitter, Facebook, and many other companies provide free APIs that enable developers to access the information they store on their servers; others charge for access to their APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll query a basic API to retrieve data about the [International Space Station (ISS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station). Using an API will save us time and effort, instead of doing all the computation ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizations host their APIs on **Web servers**. When you type `www.google.com` in your browser's address bar, your computer is actually asking the `www.google.com` server for a Web page, which it then returns to your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs work much the same way, except instead of your Web browser asking for a Web page, your program asks for data. The API usually returns this data in [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)](http://json.org/) format.\n",
    "\n",
    "We make an API request to the Web server we want to get data from. The server then replies and sends it to us. In Python, we use the [requests library](http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/) to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of requests. The most common is a *GET* request, which we use to retrieve data. We'll explore the other types later.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a simple *GET* request to retrieve information from the [OpenNotify API](http://open-notify.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenNotify has several API **endpoints**. An endpoint is a server route for retrieving specific data from an API. For example, the `/comments` endpoint on the reddit API might retrieve information about comments, while the `/users` endpoint might retrieve data about users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first endpoint we'll look at on OpenNotify is the `iss-now.json` endpoint. This endpoint gets the current latitude and longitude position of the ISS. A data set wouldn't be a great fit for this task because the information changes often, and involves some calculation on the server.\n",
    "\n",

    "* `200` - Everything went okay, and the server returned a result (if any)\n",
